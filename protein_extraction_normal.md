# Protein extraction protocol for proteomics
### For protein samples on polycarbonate filters
### Developed in the Saito lab by Dawn Moran, modified here by Noelle Held (Mia's Version)

### Materials
* Protein Lo bind or ethanol clean 2mL microfuge tubes, 4 per sample
  * Sample # _______ * 4 = ______
* Forceps
* Pipette Tips
  * 1000ul - 4* Sample # + 10.
  * 200ul - 2* Sample # + 10. 
* Shaker
* Centrifuge - large and small
   
### Chemicals
* SDS extraction buffer (1% SDS, 0.1M Tris HCL, pH 7.5, 10mM EDTA)
   * Stored in non-hazardous secondary containment in ACB chemical shelf 
   * SDS powder - corrosives cabinet 
   * EDTA powder - RT on chemical shelf
* Acetone Solvent 50% methanol, 50% acetone, 0.5mM HCL precipitaton solution (ice cold)
  * Stored in bottom shelf of chemicals when not in use

### Preparation
1. Prepare acetone solvent: 
   1. Combine 100ml methanol, 100ml acetone, 8.35ul concentrated HCl 
   2. Can eyeball 
   3. Place in freezer or on ice
2. Make 10% SDS stock if unavailable
   1. Measure 20g SDS and combine with ~190ml of MQ
   2. Heat and stir, top off to 200ml
   3. If it has precipitated, heat and stir
3. Prepare SDS extraction buffer:
   1. For 500ml: combine 50ml 1M Tris HCl, 50ml 10% SDS stock, 2.922438g EDTA, and 400ml MQ 

### Protocol Day 1
1. Bring the samples up to ACB lab on ice
2. Carefully unfold filter and arrange in a clean 2mL tube to maximize surface area exposed to solvent
   1. Scrunch 47mm filters facing upward
maybe cut 
3. Add minimal amount (often 1 mL) SDS extraction buffer to cover and incubate at RT 15mins
4. Shake 400RPM at 95C for 10 minutes
5. Shake RT 350RPM 1hr
6. Decant extract (pipette) into a new 2mL tube and centrifuge high speed for 15mins at room temperature
   1. Retain filters in freezer until samples are run
7. Remove supernatants, carefully leaving the pellet (debris) in the original tube
   1. Retain the pellet until samples are run just in case extraction was not successful
8. If the sample >300ul, CONCENTRATE supernatants in 6mL Vivaspin columns to approximately 2-300uL
   1. Centrifuge at RT 3000RPM for 15mins, then in 5min intervals as needed
   2. Remove supernatant using a 200ul pipette
   3. Use your judgement about concentration of the sample
9. If needed, perform a preliminary BCA protein concentration assay
   1. Perform assay if you want extraction efficiency to calculate absolute quantification of protein later on
10. Place the sample in a clean 2mL tube and add 50:50 solvent mixture in a 1:4 ratio in the chemical hood.
    1. Ex. 300ul sample + 1200ul Acetone Solvent 
11. Leave samples at 4C overnight or longer to precipitate the proteins.
    1. Place in secondary containment 
    2. Three days is a good amount of time

### Protocol Day 2
12. At end of precipitation period, centrifuge the precipitated protein mixture to collect the proteins, usually 10-15mins at 4C high speed
13. In chemical hood, quickly remove supernatant to another clean tube
    1. Retain supernatant in freezer until samples are run (proteins may continue to precipitate)
14. Fully dry protein pellet by speedvac 10mins 
    1. If speedvac is unavailable, leave in chemical hood for 10-15mins 
15. Resuspend pellets in minimal SDS buffer at room temperature (shaking may be needed) - about 1hr to totally dissolve
    1. Start with 75ul and add 50ul as needed to resuspend
    2. If heating is necessary, shake at 350RPM at 37C in 5min periods
    3. If not dissolved, note the extent of dissolution 
16. Quantify the proteins with the BCA protein assay

### Disposal 
* After samples are run dispose of and have reusable data 
  * Filters - trash 
  * Pellets - trash
  * Leftover supernatant from step 13
    * Dump supernatant into organic waste product 
    * Let tubes blow off in hood, then trash 
* Vivaspins in trash 
* Pipette Tips
  * Non hazardous chemicals - Trash
  * Hazardous chemicals - Dry in chemical hood for a few days and then trash
