# BCA Protein assay
### Adapted by the Saito lab and written here by Noelle Held; see also associated user's manual (Mia Version) 

### Materials
* 5uL of each sample to be tested
* 2ug/uL bovine serum albumin solution (BSA)
* Sample buffer (whatever your sample is dissolved in currently, often SDS)
* Kit Solutions A, B, and C
* 95 well microplate
* Microplate sticky cover
* Byony plate reader
* Reservoir 
* Pipette Tips
  * 1000 - 
  * 200 - Sample # *2 + 20
  * 20 - Sample # + 10

### Procedure
1. Fill in the plate template below with duplicates of your samples
    1. One plate fits 40 samples
2. Prepare standards by pipetting 50 µL of your sample buffer (SDS) into rows B-H, column 1.
3. Add 100 µL of the BSA solution to the first well of the standard row (A1)
4. Pipette 50 µL from first well (A1) into the second well (B1)
    1. Mix by pipetting, switch tip
    2. Repeat until you are finished with all but the last well (H1) (see figure below)
5. Prepare kit solution: 250 µL A, 240 µL B, 10 µL C. You will need 40 µL per sample to be tested
6. Pipette 5 µL of your standards into neighboring wells
    1. Pipette only down to the first click to avoid bubbles
7. Pipette 5 µL of your samples to be tested into their wells
8. Add 95 µL of the kit solution to each well
  1. Place solution into reservoir to use a multi pipette 
  2. Mix gently with pipette and replace 
10. Place sticky cover on plate and shake by hand gently, then incubate at 37°C for 30 min – 1 hour (no longer)
11. Measure by Byony
12. Analysis
    1. Create a standard curve with results from Column #2
    2. Subtract background value from H2
    3. Use standard curve to assign µg/µL values to samples
    4. Multiply by 1000 and average duplicates to find protein concentration
