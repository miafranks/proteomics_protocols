# BCA Protein assay
### Adapted by the Saito lab and written here by Noelle Held; see also associated user's manual (Mia's Version) 

### Materials
* 5uL of each sample to be tested
* 2ug/uL bovine serum albumin solution (BSA)
* Sample buffer (whatever your sample is dissolved in currently, often SDS)
* Kit Solutions A, B
* 15ml Falcon tube 
* 95 well microplate
* Microplate sticky cover
* Byony plate reader
* Reservoir 
* Pipette Tips
  * 1000 - 1-2 
  * 200 - Sample# * 2 + 20
  * 20 - Sample# + 10

### Procedure
1. Fill in the plate template below with duplicates of your samples
    1. One plate fits 40 samples
2. Prepare standards by pipetting 50 µL of your sample buffer (SDS) into rows B-H, column 1.
3. Add 100 µL of the BSA solution to the first well of the standard row (A1)
4. Pipette 50 µL from first well (A1) into the second well (B1)
    1. Mix by pipetting, switch tip
    2. Repeat down the column until you are finished with all but the last well (H1) (see figure below)
5. Prepare kit solution by mixing 50 parts A to 1 part B. You will need ~100 µL per sample to be tested
  1. A: 100ul * [(41*2)+8] = A ul 
  2. B: A/50 = B ul 
  3. Protect solution from light 
6. Pipette 5 µL of your standards into neighboring wells, column 2
    1. Pipette only down to the first click to avoid bubbles
7. Pipette 5 µL of your samples to be tested into their wells following your template 
8. Add 95 µL of the kit solution to each well
  1. Place solution into reservoir to use a multi-channel pipette 
  2. Mix gently with pipette and replace, careful of bubbles 
9. Place sticky cover on plate and shake by hand gently, then incubate at 37°C for 30 min (no longer than 1hr)
10. Measure by Byony
11. Analysis
    1. Create a standard curve with results from Column #2
    2. Subtract background value from H2
    3. Use standard curve to assign µg/µL values to samples
    4. Multiply by 1000 and average duplicates to find protein concentration
