### Developed in the Saito Lab by Vladimir Bulygin and Dawn Moran; adapted here by Noelle Held. See also Lu and Zhu Mol Cel Proteomics 2005

### Materials
* Use protein low bind plastics OR you can use ethanol washed 0.5mL and 2mL tubes, one each per sample. To wash - rinse 1x in clean ethanol, allow to air dry in a dust free environment such as a fume hood. This reduces contamination by plasticizers. <br>
  * 0.5ml tubes - Sample #
  * 1.5ml tubes - 4 * Sample # + 1
* At least 25ug sample protein (can be less, but more difficult)<br>
* Shaker <br>
* Centrifuge <br>
* Nanodrop <br>
* Pipette Tips 
  * 1000 - 14 * Sample # + 20
  * 200 - 6 * Sample # + 10
  * 20 - 4 * Sample # + 10
* Serological pippette - 25ml, 100ml tips
* New bottles for solutions need to be rinsed with LCMS grade H2O

### Preparation
## Day 1
1. Prepare premix on ice: 1 part Tris HCL, 3 parts 40% Bis-acryl L. 
   1. Total premix: 110ul * Sample # / 1000 = __________ mL premix (round up to nearest ml)

7. FOLLOWING BSA ASSAY: Decide amount of protein to digest 
   1. Ideal goal is 25-50ug and up to 100ug digestions
8. Calculate amount of sample for each digestion (Vol to digest). 
   1. In excel: 25ug / Sample ug/ul(from BSA Assay) = _______ul of sample

   2. If the calulcated sample amount is... 
      1. 0-87ul: Put value in 'Vol to Digest' column. Fill in TE buffer with vol to total 87. (Ex 40ul sample + 47ul TE)
      2. 87-150ul: Put 87 in 'Vol to digest' column and 0 in TE buffer
      3. 150+ul: Make double gels: 400ul total: 206 premix, 0 TE, ENTIRE SAMPLE, 14ul APS, 6ul TEMED.

### Protocol
## Day 1
1. Label a set of 0.5ml tubes. 
2. Following the table above: 
   1. Add 103uL Premix to each tube
   2. Add sample and TE buffer to total 87ul 
   3. Vortex
   4. Add 3ul TEMED 
   5. Vortex
3. To finish the gel, quickly add 7ul APS to one tube and vortex. Repeat for all samples. 
   1. Work quickly. Volumes and concentrations are critical at this stage. Be sure the APS and TEMED both make their way into solution. If the gels do not cure, usually it means either the APS or TEMED concentrations are incorrect or the solution was not properly mixed. If the sample is precious, you can add a small amount of TEMED and APS, vortex, and see if the gels will cure. However, this will result in different crosslinking across samples which may affect digestion efficiency, so avoid this if possible (e.g. start over if there is enough sample).
4. Allow to polymerize on bench 20min at RT with no shaking
   1. If not polymerized, add more TEMED and APS (same amounts)
5. In the chemical hood, add 200uL gel fix solution to gels, incubate RT 20min
   1. Label a new set of 1.5ml tubes 
6. Transfer gels to new 1.5ml tubes
   1. Pipette liquid to new tubes
   2. Use 200ul pipette tip to unstick gels from tubes and transfer gels
7. Fix gels 
   1. In chemical hood, add additional 800ul gel fix solution (enough to cover) 
   2. Shake at RT 350RPM for 45 min. 
8. Destain gels
   1. In chemical hood, remove gel fix liquid
   2. Add 800uL destain solution
   3. Incubate 30 min RT 350RPM. 
   4. Remove destain 
   5. This is not necessary if your gel was not stained (in this protocol, there is no stain so you can skip this step)
9. Cut gels 
   1. In chemical hood, remove liquid from gels
   2. Clean an acrylic square and two scalpels/razor blades with 70% ethanol
   3. Decant gels onto square and cut into 1mm cubes
   4. Place gel pieces back in tube <br>
 <u> Note: that here we have been experimenting with gel crushers in the centrifuge for higher throughput.</u> 
10. In chemical hood, add 1mL 50:50 wash, shake 25C 350RPM for 1hr. <br>
<u> Note: This is a good place to break, gels can remain in incubator over night in the 50/50 wash if needed </u> <br>
<u> Note: This may be an opportunity to transfer gels to a well-plate format (e.g. 96 deep well plates) allowing use of a multichannel pipette for the remaining steps. </u>

## Day 2
11. In the chemical hood, remove first 50:50 wash solution, repeat wash step by shaking at RT 350RPM for 1hr
    1. Once finished, set shaker to 56C
12. Dehydrate gels 
    1. Remove second wash step in chemical hood 
    2. Add 800uL acetonitrile
    3. Vortex
    4. Incubate RT 5-10min
    5. Remove supernatant
    6. Repeat 2x until gels pieces are hard, crunchy, and white. 
13. Add 600uL DTT solution, shake 1hr 56C 350RPM
14. Calculate hydrated gel volume
    1. Remove liquid with a 1000ul pipette
    2. Set pipette to ~400ul (reduce this if small gels), intake all liquid, and spin down pipette volumn until the tip is full 
    3. Record pipette volume as how much liquid was absorbed by the gels
15. Rinse: Add 600uL Ambic 25, vortex, and remove
16. In the chemical hood, with minimal light, add 600uL Ioda solution, incubate 1hr RT 350RPM in the dark (cover with foil)
17. Rinse: 
    1. Remove Ioda in chemical hood
    2. Add 1mL Ambic 25
    3. Vortex
    4. Incubate 5-10min RT 350RPM until hydrated 
    5. Remove solution
18. Dehydrate gels 
    1. Add 1000uL acetonitrile
    2. Vortex
    3. Incubate RT 5-10min
    4. Remove supernatant
    5. Repeat 2x until gels pieces are hard, crunchy, and white. 
19. Make 0.1ug/ul Trypsin during last 30 minutes of IODA incubation
    1. After removing from the -80 freezer, resuspend 100ug Promega trypsin gold by directly adding 1000ul Ambic 25, on ice 
    2. Let sit at least 30 mins to dissolve fully with very gentle vortexing
    3. IF TRYPSIN stocks are available in freezer: thaw desired amount on ice (calculate desired amount first below)
       1. Be sure you are using the correct concentrations as we have different protocols with different trypsin solutions
20. Calculate desired concentration of trypsin based on amount of protein 
    1. Trypsin:protein ratio in digestion is 1:20
    2. Ex if samples are ~25ug/ul, ug trypsin is 1.25ug, and 12.5ul of 0.1ug/ul trypsin is added 
21. Digest 
    1. Add volume of trypsin for the desired 1ug trypsin enzyme per 20ug of experimental protein ratio
    2. Add minimal amount of Ambic 25 to ensure rehydrated gels are covered in liquid
22. Spot check the pH of the solutions in a few samples using a pH strip 
    1. Drop 5uL of solution onto the strip
    2. The pH should be ~8, if not adjust it (Add drop of 10% HCl or NaOH solution and recheck)
23. Incubate at 37C for 20mins 
24. Check that the gels are completely covered (but avoid having excess liquid, you want the gels to be just about hydrated and covered)
    1. If needed, add minimal amount of Ambic 25 to ensure rehydrated gels are covered with liquid
25. Vortex, briefly spin down and incubate 37C 350RPM overnight
26. If new trypsin was reconstituted, freeze any extra trypsin at -80C in small aliquots to be used later and LABEL VERY WELL.
    1. 1-200ul aliquots - note Tryp batch 

## Day 3: END of digestion period
27. Label a new set of 1.5ml tubes 
28. Spin down samples, collect liquid supernatant into new set of tubes
29. Extract peptides
    1. Add 50uL peptide extraction buffer
    2. Vortex
    3. Incubate 20mins RT
    4. Spin down and collect suspension, combining with liquid supernatant from above
    5. Repeat extraction step, combining the suspensions
    6. Retain gels in freezer
30. Spin the samples (collected supernatant) 20mins at high speed to remove any remaining debris
31. Label a new set of 1.5ml tubes in detail with necessary sample information
32. Collect the top 90% off the centrifuged samples
    1. If speed vac is unavailable, stop here and put samples in -80 freezer
33. Concentrate on speed vac on low (as needed). 
    1. Note the volumes by measuring with a pipette
    2. Calculate the final estimated concentration of protein
    3. Measure protein concentration on nanodrop 
    4. Typically we seek 1ug/uL mixtures that are later diluted to 0.1ug/uL in desired buffer (Buffer B or 0.1% formic acid) and acidified to pH 4 for LC-MS/MS analysis. 
34. Fill out following table to make 0.1mg/ml 50ul aliquots: 

| Sample | Volume | Protein mg/ml | Total Protein | Vol protein for 0.1mg/ml | Vol Buffer | Total Vol | Final Nanodrop Protein mg/ml |
|--------|------------------------|---------------|--------------------------|------------|-----------|------------------------------|
|        |                        |               |                          |            |           |                              |
|        |                        |               |                          |            |           |                              |
|        |                        |               |                          |            |           |                              |
