# Tube gel digestion
### Developed in the Saito Lab by Vladimir Bulygin and Dawn Moran; adapted here by Noelle Held. See also Lu and Zhu Mol Cel Proteomics 2005

### Materials
* Use protein low bind plastics OR you can use ethanol washed 0.5mL and 2mL tubes, one each per sample. To wash - rinse 1x in clean ethanol, allow to air dry in a dust free environment such as a fume hood. This reduces contamination by plasticizers. <br>
* At least 25ug sample protein (can be less, but more difficult)<br>
* Shaker <br>
* Centrifuge <br>
* Nanodrop <br>
* Pipette Tips 
  * 1000 - 
  * 200 - 
  * 20 - 
* Serological pippette - 25ml, 100ml tips 
* New bottles for solutions need to be rinsed with LCMS grade H2O

### Chemicals
Make everything in LCMS (Liquid Chromatography Mass Spectroscopy) grade H2O, use only LCMS grade solvents<br>
## Stocks 
* LCMS grade acetonitrile - chemical hood, shared shelf stable<br>
* LCMS grade methanol - bottom shelf of chemical hood
* TEMED (full concentration) - in corrosive cabinet <br>

### Preparation
## Day 1
1. Prepare premix on ice: 1 part Tris HCL, 3 parts 40% Bis-acryl L. 
   1. Total premix: 110ul * Sample # / 1000 = __________ mL premix (round up to nearest ml)
   2. Tric HCl: Total premix ml * 252 = _________________ uL Tris HCl
   3. Add in HOOD: Bis-acryl L: Total premix ml * 736.5 = __________________ uL Bis-acryl L. 
2. Prepare Ambic 25: We usually make this by diluting an Ambic 100mM solution as needed.
   1. From 100mM Ambic: Combine 1:4, 100mM ambic: MQ water
3. Prepare Gel Fix solution: 
   1. 50% Ethanol, 10% acetic acid in LC water
4. Prepare Gel Destain solution: 
   1. 50% Methanol, 10% acetic acid in LC water
5. Prepare 50/50 wash: 
   1. 50% ACN, 50% Ambic25
6. Prepare 1% Ammonium persulfate (APS): 
   1. In a 1.5mL tube, mix 10mg Ammonium persulfate in 1mL MQ H20. 
7. FOLLOWING BSA ASSAY: Decide amount of protein to digest 
   1. Ideal goal is 25-50ug and up to 100ug digestions
8. Calculate amount of sample for each digestion (Vol to digest). 
   1. In excel: 25ug / Sample ug/ul(from BSA Assay) = _______ul of sample 
9. Fill out the following table: 
   1. Gels total 200ul
   2. If the calulcated sample amount is... 
      1. 0-87ul: Put value in 'Vol to Digest' column. Fill in TE buffer with vol to total 87. (Ex 40ul sample + 47ul TE)
      2. 87-150ul: Put 87 in 'Vol to digest' column and 0 in TE buffer
      3. 150+ul: Make double gels: 400ul total: 206 premix, 0 TE, ENTIRE SAMPLE, 14ul APS, 6ul TEMED.

    1. 50% LCMS Acetonitrile, 5% formic acid in water (LCMS grade)
    2. For 200ml total: 100ml ACN + 90ml LCMS water + 10ml Formic Acid

### Protocol
## Day 1
1. Label a set of 0.5ml tubes. 
2. Following the table above: 
   1. Add 103uL Premix to each tube
   2. Add sample and TE buffer to total 87ul 
   3. Vortex
   4. Add 3ul TEMED 
   5. Vortex
3. To finish the gel, quickly add 7ul APS to one tube and vortex. Repeat for all samples. 
   1. Work quickly. Volumes and concentrations are critical at this stage. Be sure the APS and TEMED both make their way into solution. If the gels do not cure, usually it means either the APS or TEMED concentrations are incorrect or the solution was not properly mixed. If the sample is precious, you can add a small amount of TEMED and APS, vortex, and see if the gels will cure. However, this will result in different crosslinking across samples which may affect digestion efficiency, so avoid this if possible (e.g. start over if there is enough sample).
4. Allow to polymerize in thermomixer 20min at 20C with no shaking
5. In the chemical hood, add 200uL gel fix solution to gels, incubate RT 20min
   1. Label a new set of 2ml tubes 
6. Transfer gels to new 2ml tubes
   1. Pipette liquid to new tubes
   2. Use 200ul pipette tip to unstick gels from tubes and transfer gels
7. Fix gels 
   1. In chemical hood, add additional 800ul gel fix solution (enough to cover) 
   2. Shake at RT 350RPM for 30 min. 
8. Destain gels
   1. In chemical hood, remove gel fix liquid
   2. Add 1000uL destain solution
   3. Incubate 30 min RT 350RPM. 
   4. This is not necessary if your gel was not stained (in this protocol, there is no stain so you can skip this step)
9. Cut gels 
   1. In chemical hood, remove liquid from gels
   2. Clean an acrylic square and two scalpels/razor blades with 70% ethanol
   3. Decant gels onto square and cut into 1mm cubes
   4. Place gel pieces back in tube <br>
 <u> Note that here we have been experimenting with gel crushers in the centrifuge for higher throughput.</u> 
10. Add 1mL 50:50 wash, shake 350RPM for 1hr. <br>
<u> Note: This is a good place to break, gels can remain in incubator over night in the 50/50 wash if needed </u> <br>
<u> Note: This may be an opportunity to transfer gels to a well-plate format (e.g. 96 deep well plates) allowing use of a multichannel pipette for the remaining steps. </u>

## Day 2
* Remove first 50:50 wash solution, repeat wash step for 1 hour
* Dehydrate gels by adding 0.8mL acetonitrile, vortex, incubate RT 5-10min and remove supernatant. Repeat 2x until gels pieces are hard, crunchy, and white. 
* Add 600uL DTT solution, mix 1hr 56C 350RPM
* Remove liquid with a pipette tip, and note how much liquid absorbed by the gels (to calculate hydrated gel volume)
* Add 600uL Ambic 25, vortex, and remove (rinse step)
* Add 600uL Ioda solution, incubate 1hr RT 350RPM in the dark (cover with foil)
* Remove any remaining Ioda, add 1mL ambic25, vortex, incubate 5-10min RT 350RPM until hydrated and remove solution
* Dehydrate with 0.8mL ACN, 10min room temperature and remove solution, repeat 2x as before until hard and crunchy. 
* Meanwhile, resuspend 100ug promega trypsin gold in 1000uL ambic on ice, allow to sit at least 30 mins to dissolve fully with very gentle vortexing OR use previously reconstituted trypsin, be sure you are using the correct concentrations as we have different protocols with different trypsin solutions. 
* The desired trypsin:protein ratio in the digestion solution is 1:20 ug:ug. Calculate the desired concentration of trypsin based on the amoint of your protein to reach this amount below:

| Sample | ug protein | ug trypsin 1:20 | volume pellet | ug trypsin/ vol pellet |   | vol  trypsin | vol ambic |
|--------|------------|-----------------|---------------|------------------------|---|--------------|-----------|
|        |            |                 |               |                        |   |              |           |
|        |            |                 |               |                        |   |              |           |
|        |            |                 |               |                        |   |              |           |
|        |            |                 |               |                        |   |              |           |
|        |            |                 |               |                        |   |              |           |
|        |            |                 |               |                        |   |              |           |
|        |            |                 |               |                        |   |              |           |

* Add trypsin to reach the desired ug of trypsin (1 ug trypsin enzyme per 20ug of experimental protein). Then add ambic25 to cover the gels. Spot check the pH of the solutions in a few samples using a pH strip (drop 5uL of solution onto the strip). The pH should be ~8, if not adjust it.
* Incubate at 37C for 20mins. Then, check that the gels are completely covered (but avoid having excess liquid, you want the gels to be just about hydrated and covered). Add minimal amount of Ambic 25 to ensure rehydrated gels are covered with liquid if needed.
* If new trypsin was reconstituted, freeze any extra trypsin at -80C in small aliquots to be used later and LABEL VERY WELL.
* Vortex, briefly spin down and incubate 37C 350RPM overnight. Spot check the pH of the solutions in a few samples using a pH strip (drop 5uL of solution onto the strip). The pH should be ~8, if not adjust it. 

## Day 3
* END of digestion period:
* Spin down, collect liquid supernatant into clean 1.5mL tubes
* Add 50uL peptide extraction buffer, vortex, incubate 20mins RT
* Spin down and collect suspension, combine with liquid supernatant from above
* Repeat extraction step, combining the suspensions
* Spin the samples (supernatant) 20mins at high speed to remove any remaining debris
* Collect the top 90% off the centrifuged samples and concentrate on speed vac on low (as needed). Note the volumes and calculate the final estimated concentration of protein. Typically we seek 1ug/uL mixtures that are later diluted to 0.1ug/uL in Buffer B and acidified to pH 4 for LC-MS/MS analysis. 
    * If speedvac unavailable, store in -80 after collecting 90%
